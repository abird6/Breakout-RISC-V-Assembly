# Breakout-RISC-V-Assembly
Re-creating the popular Atari arcade game Breakout using RISC-V assembly programming language

This project is segmented into 2 stages A & B.

Stage A:
  - Initialise arena, wall, paddle and ball on 32x16 display
      * x-coordinates dictated by 32 bit memory value
      * y-coordinates dictated by memory address
  - Implement up/down ball movement
  - Lose a life when ball misses paddle, respawn ball on arena 
  - Bounce when ball contacts paddle
  - Score a point when ball contacts wall
  - Remove wall segment after ball contact

Stage B:
  - Implement NE, NW, SW, SE ball movement 
  - Display 'GAME OVER' on arena display when all lives lost
  - Reflect new ball movement on paddle bounces
  - Implement ball bounce upon arena boundary contact
